/// for the <see cref="Journal"/> or other <see cref="IEntry{T}"/> store. This happens when a sequenced value is
/// obtained, but the table row inserts are not serialized in the same order. The threads inserting
/// race to the physical writes, causing logical ordering with gaps for small time windows. Thus, a
/// range query may see gaps in the sequences if run during inserts at the tail of the table rows.
/// Performing gap prevention involves time-delayed retries, allowing the database inserts to fill
/// the gaps caused by thread races. The gaps are easy to detect, but since they may also be caused
/// by transactions that roll back where with sequence values that are wasted/lost, following the
/// number of retries with time delays the reader should still provide results with gaps. This
/// recognizes that following best effort the gaps may never close, and thus be warranted.
